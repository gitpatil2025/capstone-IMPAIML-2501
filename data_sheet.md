# Model Datasheet:


## Motivation

- **Purpose**: The dataset was created to support machine learning models for detecting and classifying car damage. 
  It’s intended for use in computer vision tasks such as damage localization and severity classification.
- **Creator**: Anuj M S uploaded the dataset to Kaggle.
- **Funding**: No funding source is specified; likely a personal or academic contribution.


## Composition

- **Instances**: The dataset consists of labeled images of cars with visible damage.
- **Types**: Images are categorized under folder `data1a`, which may represent different damage types or severity levels.
- **Size**: The exact number of images varies by folder, but the total dataset includes 2299 images.
- **Missing Data**: No explicit mention of missing data, but some folders may have inconsistent naming or labeling.
- **Confidentiality**: The dataset contains publicly available car images and does not include personally identifiable information or sensitive content.


## Collection Process

- **Acquisition**: Images were likely sourced from public domains or manually collected, though the dataset card does not specify.
- **Sampling Strategy**: Not documented but appears to be a convenience sample.
- **Time Frame**: The dataset was uploaded 6 years ago, collection dates are not provided.


## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

- **Labeling**: Images are organized into folders that imply damage categories or severity, but no structured annotation files (e.g., bounding boxes or segmentation masks) are included.
- **Preprocessing**: No preprocessing is described. Users may need to resize, normalize or annotate images manually.
- **Raw Data**: Only raw image files are provided; no preprocessed versions are included.



## Uses

- **Other Tasks**:
  - Damage severity classification
  - Transfer learning for vehicle inspection
  - Dataset augmentation for insurance automation
- **Risks**:
  - Lack of annotation structure may limit supervised learning applications.
  - Dataset may not generalize across vehicle types, lighting conditions or damage scenarios.
  - Folder-based labeling may introduce ambiguity or bias.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Users should validate models on diverse datasets and consider manual annotation for bounding boxes or segmentation.
  - Avoid deploying models without domain-specific calibration.
- **Unsuitable Uses**:
  - Should not be used for legal assessments, owner identification or cost estimation without additional data and validation.


## Distribution

- **Availability**: Distributed via Kaggle.
- **IP/ToU**: No explicit license is listed, users should follow Kaggle’s standard terms of use.


## Maintenance

- **Maintainer**: Anuj M S (via Kaggle). No update schedule or contact information is provided.
